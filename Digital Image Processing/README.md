This folder contains all the functions and scripts used to implemented the research paper titled
"A Hessian-Free Gradient Flow (HFGF) method for the optimisation of deep learning neural networks".

In order to test the code, and to obtain the result which is table 2 in the main reseach paper, which can be found at
download this folder, add its path to Matlab, and  simply run Test_HFGF script.

What is happening underneath the hood?
Test_HFGF script will call the main code of the paper named as main_HFGF and will send 4 different testing functions 
and return the information needed to construct the table. Inside the main_HFGF, there is a call to armijo function to obtain the step size alpha.
